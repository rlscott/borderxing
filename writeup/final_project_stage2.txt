Outline of planned data exploration (by group member): 

Zihao Yang
1. Compare the seasonal part of Mexico and Canada border and compare them with each other (just select the normal time).
2. Compare the impact of big event(911, covid) on the value of Mexico and Canada.
3. Compare the 3 largest ports (El Paso, Buffalo, and Detroit -- these 3 ports are selected by the top10 value in Canada and Mexico). I want to compare the transport proportion and trend of them. 
4. Compare the period time that port closed.

Rebekah Scott
1. Compute summary statistics for the ports (how many on each border, by state, etc) 
2. See if I can make a cool map (maybe using density of some measure or something... )
3. Work with the multinomial distributions of the different measures by port. Compute the average and median distribution of measures for all ports and do a goodness of fit test on each port of entry to see if it significantly differs from the median (just using p-values). Maybe I'll split things up further into the average of the Canadian and Mexican borders... 

Liam Hemingway (all in the context of Mexico)
1. Look at the effect of historical events.
2. Investigate which ports and which types of crossings were more or less resistant to these historical events.
3. Determine causes of anomalies in certain transportation types i.e., the random spikes in the graphs.

Min-Yi Chen (all in the context of Canada)
1. Analyze the trend beyond decades.
2. Investigate Montana with the measure bus to see the dramatic change.
